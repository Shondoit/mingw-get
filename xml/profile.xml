      The "repository" specification identifies the URI where package
      list catalogues may be downloaded; each catalogue download URI is
      identified by substituting the catalogue name for the "%F" field
      in the uri specification.

      FIXME: package lists specified here will inhibit searching of any
      master index maintained on the repository server.  At present, the
      master index search facility is unsupported, so only these locally
      specified package lists will be loaded; remove them when the index
      search feature becomes available, to enable master index search.

  <system-map id="default">
    <!--
      The system map specifies the installation paths for each managed
      subsystem.  Multiple system maps are supported, provided each is
      given a unique "id" attribute; each specifies an "installation",
      comprising a collection of subsystems, each of which in turn is
      associated with a specific "sysroot path".
      
      Each individual "sysroot path" defines one installation of one
      specific subsystem; parallel installations may be supported by
      assigning distinct paths to two or more sysroot specifications
      for the same subsystem; each such sysroot specification must
      then be assigned to a distinct system-map.

      Any single sysroot definition may be shared by any number of
      system-maps, simply by duplicating that definition within each;
      however, each system-map may contain only one sysroot definition
      for each individual subsystem.

      Only one system map may be active at any time.  Unless otherwise
      specified by user selection, the first encountered is accepted as
      default, irrespective of its actual "id" attribute value.
