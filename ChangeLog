	the class destructor, it encapsulates separate calls to...
	(pkgVersionInfo::Free): ...this original inline method, renamed...
	(pkgVersionInfo::FreeEntry): ...as this.

	Work around an autoconf bug (reported by Stefano Sabatini).

	* Makefile.in (VPATH): Use @top_srcdir@ instead of ${srcdir}; current
	autoconf incorrectly elides references to @srcdir@ and ${srcdir} when

	portability to non-GNU implementations of make; (recommendation by

	for the containing package.

	Make provision to protect user's profile settings during upgrade.

	(install-profile): ...this new prerequisite installation goal; it
	renames the installed copy of `profile.xml' as `defaults.xml', within
	the installed package image.

	* src/pkgkeys.h (defaults_key): New key; declare it.
	* src/pkgkeys.c: Some cosmetic formatting (tabulation) adjustments.
	(defaults_key): Implement it; it refers to the `defaults.xml' file.

	* src/climain.cpp (climain): Check `profile_key' for accessibility of
	the `profile.xml' file; if [! R_OK] emit a diagnostic warning, fall
	back on `defaults_key', and attempt to load configuration from the

2010-05-11  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Add preliminary support for future `-reinstall' option.

	* src/pkgexec.cpp (pkgActionItem::Execute) [ACTION_INSTALL]: Force

	mechanism for interpreting user specified options.
