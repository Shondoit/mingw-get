 * Simple driver program, for the lexical package name analyser, as
 * implemented in the "flex" file "pkginfo.l".  When compiled as:
 *
 *   lex -t pkginfo.l > pkginfo.c
 *   gcc -o pkginfo driver.c pkginfo.c
 *
 * it creates a simple command line tool for analysis and validation
 * of package archive names, in accordance with agreed MinGW Project
 * package naming conventions.
